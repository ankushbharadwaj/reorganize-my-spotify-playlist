# Reorganize My Spotify Playlist with Data Science

In this project, I use data science to break a large Spotify playlist into smaller playlists. By using principal component analysis and K Means clustering, as well as audio features for each track in my Spotify playlist, accessed through Spotify's Web API, I reorganized one of my large Spotify playlists into smaller playlists.
